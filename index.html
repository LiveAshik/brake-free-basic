                                <p>Meaning you can just focus on training and stop guessing if your workouts<br> are

                            <p>I'm Kitty Blomfield, CEO and Co-founder of the<br> WinAtLife program and I’m guessing if
                                you’re here,<br> we’ve had similar experiences with food and diets.</p>

                            <p>For 17 years of my life I followed restrictive diets and <br>worked out 6-7 days a week.
                                <i>And I was miserable.</i> </p>

                            <p>I rarely slept through the night, I was bloated, <br>
                                my moods were up and down like a yo-yo, I had no <br> energy and crazy sugar cravings.
                                My period was<br> irregular and painful. Every time I lost weight, <br>
                                I just put it back on again.
                            </p>

                            <p>But that all changed for me in 2015 when I met Emma<br> Sgourakis, the nutritionist who
                                told me having the<br> body I wanted didn’t mean living off nuts and seeds.<br> She told
                                me it was okay to drink chocolate milk! </p>

                            <p>Around this time I also met Craig McDonald (my now<br> partner) who introduced me to a
                                new way of training<br> that didn’t require me to work out 6 days a week or<br> do
                                endless cardio.

                        <p>Emma and Craig showed me a new, healthier way to achieve the <br>body I wanted. That
                            <i>didn’t</i> involve obsessively working out or giving up <br>the foods I loved.</p>

                        <p>I had never felt healthier or more confident in my body. I knew that if this had <br>changed
                            my life, it could change the lives of so many other women too.</p>

                        <p>With my partner Craig, we developed one of the most comprehensive and <br>scientifically
                            proven coaching programs available online for women. </p>

                        <p>Now, we teach women how to change their relationship to food and their body <br>
                            so that they can free themselves from a life of punishing workouts, restrictive diets,
                            <br>low energy, cravings and mood swings. </p>

                        <p>The 1000’s of women who have gone through our programs have told us that <br>
                            they’ve not only healed their relationship with food and their body, but they’re also
                            <br>happier and more confident in all aspects of their life. </p>

                        <p>In fact, they’ve told us time and again that working with us <br>
                            and our programs has changed their life!
